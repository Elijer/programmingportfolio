# Using JSX without React
[This project heavily relies on this post](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-jsx-without-react-21d23346e5dc) to run.

The problem is that if you are appending the SAME element over and over again within a loop,
Nothing happens, because the same element is being appended over again!

# Notes
There a couple things I could still add:
1. The project I created for katie, (include Twilio usage)
2. The work I put into Str8hmp.com (include Liquid and shopify)
3. Network, when I'm done.
4. Whatever my final project is
5. The running pace app
